    <h2>The 10 Most Popular Programming Languages to Learn in 2022</h2>
    <p>There's no question that software programming is a hot career right now. the U.S Bureau of Labor Statistic 
        Projects 21 percent growth for programming jobs from 2018 to 2028, which is more than four times the averages
        for all occupations. what's more, the median annual pay for a software programmer is about $106,000, whicch nearly three times the median
        pay for all U.S workers.</p>
    <p>not all programming jobs are the same, however . different roles, companies, and types of software require knowing and understanding different programming languages and it's often
        beneficial to know multiple languages. trying to break into the field of software programming can be a daunting experience, 
        especially for professionals with no prior programming experience.

    <p>The <u>Master of Science in Computer Science Align Program</u> at Northeastern University is specifically designed for students who want
        to transition into computer science from another field of study.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><i>"Our aim is to transport students from a variety of different backgrounds and have them come out as 
        software engineers,"</i> says Ian Gorton, phD and director of the graduate computer science programs at Northeastern University 
        seattle. <i>"We focus on math, programming, and a variety of computer science and engineering concepts."</i></p>
    <p style="text-align: right;">Wether you're new to programming or looking to brush up on your skills. it helps to know which languages 
        are in high demand. Here are 10 of the most popular programming languages of 2020 based on the number of job postings listed on job search site indeed, the average annual
